# factorio_bot
A Slack app that sends server activity notifications to a channel

You'll need to configure a Slack app and set up an Incoming Webhook as described here: https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks#posting_with_webhooks

Copy sample_config.json -> config.json, add RCON parameters and the Slack webhook URL to config.json and run bot.py.
